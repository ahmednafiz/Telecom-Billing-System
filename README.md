# Telecom-Billing-System
With this project in C Telecom Billing System, you
can perform and manage billing operations like
they do in Telecom companies. Here, you can add
records with name, phone number and the amount
of payment. You can view, modify, search and
delete existing records.
You can also make payment by providing your
phone number instead of name. All data added or
modified are recorded in a file. This project will
teach you how to add, list, edit, search and delete
records using file handling.
